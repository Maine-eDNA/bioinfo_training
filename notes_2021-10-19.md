## Meeting notes 2021-10-19

- agenda
    - slack update
    - deciding on where to begin "hands-on" tutorial (e.g. start with cutadapt, fastQC; or keep it all in R)
    - decide on roles and responsibilities
    - discuss what to use from the differnt existing tutorial
- slack update
    - laura made it
    - won't be project-wide, just for bioinformatics
- where to start
    - command line stuff like fastQC and cutadapt might be best saved for a more advanced (future) tutorial
    - starting straight away in R would facilitate students working on their own machines
    - pros and cons
        - environment issues---will it work on people's machines?
        - will people do the work before hand?
        - if we have pre-work they could check if everything is running
        - starting part-way through pipeline means you can't do first step with your own data, so you can't do anything; so key
        - one solution?
            - use CyVerse
            - in CyVerse layer images with RStudio and whatever conda/cutadapt/fastqc versions we need
            - in advance students will need to make CyVerse accounts and understand how to launch an app
            - CyVerse is faster than binder
    - where to end
        - the simplest way to make a taxon barplot
        - question to the gruop: what else (viz wise and analysis wise) do you want to see on Friday?
- comparing tutorials
    - Mike's v. Ben's
    - Mike's is more verbose, that's good
    - Mike has a nice table of functions, which is very helpful
    - Mike sometimes jumps to command line
    - Mike looks at quality after trimming which is nice
    - for ours use Ben's as a scaffold but take some of Mike's embelishment
        - more verbose
        - table of functions
        - look at quality after trimming
- action items
    - Rene will make an outline that takes the best of both tutorials by Oct 25
    - Laura will take a first pass at CyVerse by Oct 25
    - if Laura's attempt with CyVerse doesn't work Andy will reach out to his collaborator after Oct 25
    - Andy will make mock up of flyer by Oct 25
    - test CyVerse app with Mike's tutorial
    - if it works Robin then starts building Highland Lake tutorial on CyVerse
    - send out save the date before Nov 5 all hands
    - send out final info during all hands on Nov 5
