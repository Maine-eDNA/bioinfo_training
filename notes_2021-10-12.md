## Planning meeting notes

- let's focus this training on *dada2*
- Bigelow can set up RStudio Server
- alternatively could run this through binderhub...maybe that's better
- let's use Highland lake data
- good existing tutorials:
    - https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html
    - https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex
- details of the training:
    - let's aim for 4 hour training on **Dec 1** at *10 to 12* and *1 to 3*
        - before lunch: all *dada2*
        - after lunch: analysis with taxonomy table?
    - let's offer a short 1 hour follow-up on **Dec 10** at *10*
        - to go over R analysis and plotting
        - to transition from RStudio Server to your local computer
    - goal of the training should be in part to help students self-asses and figure out what they need next
    - include some vizualization in the initial 4 hour training just to get that vizual feedback
    - anticipate 15 students
    - make a sign-up
    - mode: all remote 
- make a Maine-eDNA slack channel that can host sub-channels for things like for posting bioinformatics questions, etc
    - circulate it before the training
    - make it so you can't use zoom chat, and have to use slack channel for asking questions
- what should we assume as a base level R knowledge, and what training resources should we provide?
    - install slack
    - let's have no R pre-reqs
    - in the email inviting students to register, let's say "no pre-reqs expected, but we will be using R, if you have questions, get in touch"
- sign-up
    - send out an email with a form for people to register
    - in the registration form, have some questions about familiarity with R and metabarcoding; but be clear there's no barrior to entry
    - do a survey of the times just to be sure
- follow-up
    - start documentation on github (**Laura** will start)
    - **Laura** is going to make the google form
    - **Laura** is going to look into binderhub (maybe **we all** should)
    - **Laura** is going to set up slack
    - **Robin** will talk with Karen and Sharron about Highland Lake data
    - **everybody** thinks about how they want to contribute 
    - **everybody** reads the 2 existing tutorials
        - think about how to translate it Highland Lake data
        - look to see if there are any clear breaks in the workflow
