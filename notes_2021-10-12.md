## Planning meeting notes

- let's focus this training on *dada2*
- Bigelow can set up RStudio Server
- let's use Highland lake data
- good existing tutorials:
    - https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html
    - https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex
- details of the training:
    - let's aim for 4 hour training on **Dec 1** at *10 to 12* and *1 to 3*
    - offer a short 1 hour follow-up to go over R analysis and plotting on **Dec 10** at *10*
    - goal of the training should be in part to help students self-asses and figure out what they need next
    
    - 4 hour could be during an EES class session; 1 hour could be Friday research forum 
    - include some vizualization in the initial 4 hour training just to get that vizual feedback
- make a Maine-eDNA slack channel that can host sub-channels for things like for posting bioinformatics questions, etc
    - circulate it before the training

- what should we assume as a base level R knowledge, and what training resources should we provide?
