## Meeting notes 2021-10-26

- Highland Lake update
    - Robin got Bigelow workflow working on Highland Lake data
    - cool patterns emerging
    - question of whether we run the whole dataset or a subset---depends on what CyVerse offers
    - **To-do: Robin and Rene** will continue to work on the transfering over the workflow to the [tutorial website](https://maine-edna.github.io//Tutorial/)
- Tutorial website
    - *Rene* has already made great progress on the tutorial website!
    - anyting in ***BOLD CAPS ITALICS*** needs help
- CyVerse update
    - *Laura* has been working with CyVerse folks to build apps for this
    - it's possible CyVerse folks are a little confused about what we want with fastQC and cutadapt
        - they're saying everything (fastQC, cutadapt, R) need to be sepparate apps
        - we want one app
    - **to-do: Laura** will continue to work with them
