## Meeting notes 2021-10-26

- Highland Lake update
    - Robin got Bigelow workflow working on Highland Lake data
    - cool patterns emerging
    - question of whether we run the whole dataset or a subset---depends on what CyVerse offers
    - **To-do: Robin and Rene** will continue to work on the transfering over the workflow to the [tutorial website](https://maine-edna.github.io//Tutorial/)
- CyVerse update
    - *Laura* has been working with CyVerse folks to build apps for this
    - it's possible CyVerse folks are a little confused about what we want with fastQC and cutadapt
        - they're saying everything (fastQC, cutadapt, R) need to be sepparate apps
        - seems like they're thinking might be based around the tool they already serve: [DNA subway](https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/)
        - if we need to run everything from R we could look into some things like [fastqcr](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/fastqcr-an-r-package-facilitating-quality-controls-of-sequencing-data-for-large-numbers-of-samples)
    - but really we want one app that's based off a *new* docker container that layers images of most current versions of R, RStudio, cutadapt, fastQC
    - **to-do: Laura** will continue to work with them
- Tutorial website
    - *Rene* has already made great progress on the tutorial website!
    - anyting in ***BOLD CAPS ITALICS*** needs attention from the group
    - let's also make a bare-bones Rmd file of the code with some headers for students to download and take notes in
- Tutorial content
    - there's a cool viz pacakge, [microViz](https://github.com/david-barnett/microViz) that Andy shot down like a total ass ;) so we won't use that in the main Wednesday tutorial, but we could save it for the Friday research forum
- Other action itms
    - **Rene** will make the flyer now (thanks Rene! says Andy)
    - we will send out the flyer this week and it will include a link to register using the form Laura made
